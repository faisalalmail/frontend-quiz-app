## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

**Boy** I learned that actual real life projects are huge and require so much time and effort to finish.

This is by very far the largest project I've worked on, I am proud to say I got it to this point, there was so much to get done, functionality on one side and respnsiveness on another, but the CSS file got too big it was overwhelming to me to do anything extra with it, I felt like *I just want to get this done*.
